# Qntx_Asm
Prototype web presentation page

## Intro
Hi this is a quick prototype just to experiment with react and regain some knowledge of it.
It's pretty simple to use after you spend some minute to read this quick guide.
Actually is a Create React App project.

## Getting started
To start and see the project for making things quick i suggest to:
- From the project folder **Qntx_Asm**, move into the folder **qntx_lnd**;
- There use **npm install**, to install locally the project.

The progect require node.js + npm so install it first:

### Install Locally
- in the **Qntx_Asm/qntx_lnd** run **npm install**;
- then run **npm run start**;
- (inside there is the readme with all the aviable command);
- Voil√† le jeu son fe!

#### Enjoy!
